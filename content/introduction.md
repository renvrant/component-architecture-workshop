## Components are part of your application

---

## ... But we sometimes take them for granted
(HTML and CSS? Easy stuff!)

---

## Everything is a "component"

Note: (Examples - HTML tags, microservice... component based architecture affects how we develop every part of our applications at Rangle)

---

## We work with frameworks designed around components

Note: When we don't think about components, we don't get the full value of the frameworks we work with on a daily basis

---

## Components are the first point of entry into your application

---

## ... Which can make them a bit of a dumping ground
